This course assumes a familiarity with Python and SQL. If you need to brush up, that's totally OK! Here are some resources we recommend for getting started:

## SQL

[The Data School - Learn SQL](https://dataschool.com/learn-sql/): A great resource for everything from beginner to advanced SQL topics. `JOINs` and `WINDOWs` may be especially useful here. Their diagrams are _very_ helpful for visualizing just what's going on in certain transformations.

[DuckDB Documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/): The best place for learning all DuckDB has to offer. The docs contain guides on how to load and export data, as well as all the cool aggregations, lambdas, windows, and customizations DuckDB has to offer.

## Python

[Pandas 2.0 & It's Ecosystem](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/pandas-2-0-ecosystem-arrow-polars-duckdb/): An excellent read on the evolution of Pandas and related technologies used in this course (Polars, DuckDB).
