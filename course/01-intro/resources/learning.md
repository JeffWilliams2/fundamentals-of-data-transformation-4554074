# Refreshers

This course assumes a familiarity with Python and SQL. If you need to brush up, that's totally OK! Here are some resources we recommend for getting started:

## SQL

[The Data School - Learn SQL](https://dataschool.com/learn-sql/): A great resource for everything from beginner to advanced SQL topics. `JOINs` and `WINDOWs` may be especially useful here. Their diagrams are _very_ helpful for visualizing just what's going on in certain transformations.

[DuckDB Documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/): The best place for learning all DuckDB has to offer. The docs contain guides on how to load and export data, as well as all the cool aggregations, lambdas, windows, and customizations DuckDB has to offer.

## Python

[The Pandas docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html) are maybe the _most_ straightforward place to get started. Since the only Python we're writing in this course has to do with Pandas, this is all you need to know!

[learnpython](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Pandas_Basics) also has some great Pandas basics for you to get started. They cover some of  fundamental things about the ecosystem and how to get started.

[Pandas 2.0 & It's Ecosystem](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/pandas-2-0-ecosystem-arrow-polars-duckdb/): An excellent read on the evolution of Pandas and related technologies used in this course (Polars, DuckDB).

# Other Resources

Here are a few other resources you might be interested in for learning Python / SQL / data transformation

## Websites

Websites like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sql) and [Reddit's r/SQL](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/) are valuable for asking questions, finding solutions to problems, and learning from the experiences of others in the SQL community. The same goes for Python‚Äî check out the Python [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) and [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/)

## Platforms

I'm a DevRel @ [Replit](https://repl.it), which is a fantastic place to learn the basics of building Python applications. [Replit](https://replit.com) abstracts away environment setup and deployment architecture, so you can focus on building cool stuff, not on getting things configured.

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) provide practice problems and challenges to improve your skills through hands-on coding. Note that these sites have historically been focused on _algorithms_, not necessarily data transformation, but they're still a good resource nonetheless.

## Reading

If you're interested in Data Engineering, I've also included a white paper I worked on with Databricks: you can find it in the same folder as this file. It covers the topic of ETL, or "Extract Transform Load," which is a concept central to data / analytics engineering. Since the "T" stands for transform, and data transformation is highly related to analytics and engineering, you might find it interesting.
