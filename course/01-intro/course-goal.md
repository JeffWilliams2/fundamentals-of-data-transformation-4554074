## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The goal of this course is to give you a basis for ways of transforming data using SQL, Python, and Polars. It's meant to serve as an _introduction_ to these tools for data transformation, and not as a comprehensive guide.

It assumes some knowledge of each and moves _pretty_ quickly through these topics, given the broad scope. If you're new to any of these topics, I'd recommend checking out some of the resources in the appendix folder. But _don't worry_ I'll be sure to explain and provide examples as we go along.

## ðŸ¤” How to succeed

The most valuable resource for this course will be the _example code_ in this repo and the explainations in the videos. This repos was written in such a way that you'll be able to reference it (and run it!) forever! That means once you're done, you can go back and look at examples, fiddle with databases, or keep playing with the code.

The style of teaching in this course is _very_ hands-on. I'll be writing code and running it in real time, and I'd encourage you to do the same. The best way to learn is by doing, and I'll be providing you with plenty of opportunities to do so.

I won't explain every single detail, nor will I hold your hand. That means you'll need to think critically about what's being run and really pick through the code on your own. Yes, this is different than most courses online, but I also feel it's the most effective way to learn.
